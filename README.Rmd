The goal of dagnn is to provide a minimal package for quickly constructing neural network architectures with simple syntax. Essentially you specify a directed acyclic graph between neural network layers using a list of formulas, and `dagnn` constructs a full `torch::nn_module()` that can be used in downstream deep learning workflows.

## Installation

You can install the development version of dagnn from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rdinnager/dagnn")
```

## Example

Coming soon...

An *in-the-wild* example of using `dagnn` can be found here: https://github.com/rdinnager/bioclim_intrinsic_dimension
